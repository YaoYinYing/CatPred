CatPred Prediction and Fingerprint Generation

This script uses the CatPred model to make predictions and generate fingerprints.
It serves as an entry point for running the prediction and fingerprinting process.

Usage:
    python script_name.py

The script will execute the catpred_predict function and store the results.

Note: Ensure that the catpred package is properly installed and configured
before running this script.
